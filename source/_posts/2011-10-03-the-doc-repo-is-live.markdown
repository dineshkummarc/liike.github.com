As we begin our investigation into the specifics of tools, frameworks, and existing guidance, we're capturing our learnings on our brand new [docs repo](http://github.com/liike/docs). Over time we'll be including small topics and other written content. 

Don is also maintaining a delicious stack called [Mobile Web Dev](http://delicious.com/stacks/view/Cz4m7h) to keep track of good articles and links. If you have any choice links we should know about, throw them in the comments below.
