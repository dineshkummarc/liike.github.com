We want to be able to focus our efforts on real problems that developers and designers are facing today. We've come up with four scenarios. We need you to evaluate these, vote up the useful ones and suggest new ones.

* [Adding a mobile experience to an existing web app](/scenarios/extending-existing-apps.html)
* [Exploring large data sets on mobile devices](/scenarios/exploring-large-data-sets.html)
* [Greenfield mobile-first development](/scenarios/greenfield-mobile-first.html)
* [Secure and Long-lived Line-of-Business apps](/scenarios/line-of-business.html)

Is something missing? Let us know in the comments below. Get your friends, neighbors and coworkers to vote it up and we'll add it to the "official" list above.
