You are the technical lead for a new startup venture. The company has a brilliant new take on the social web and they want to get to market as soon as possible. They believe that their app will primarily be used on the go, but they still value a desktop experience. Funds are limited and they need to prove to investors that their product is viable quickly. High level considerations for your project are:

* Smartphones and tablets are the initial targeted devices, but the ultimate target is all browsers.
* User experience is essential (and hence responsiveness). 
* There is no existing assets, the team can use whatever stack they believe will help them achieve the goals.
* The product needs to be released early and often.
* Features should be prioritized by the anticipated ROI.
* The app should support the delivery of ads.
