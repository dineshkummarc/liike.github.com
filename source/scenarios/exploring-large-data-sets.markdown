You work for Contoso Automotive. Contoso has gathered (and continues to gather) a significant amount of data regarding the real word fuel efficiency and maintenance schedules of their vehicles. Executives at Contoso are interested in exploring this data, as well as selling access to the data. The high level considerations for your project are:

* Tablets and slates are the targeted devices.
* Touch interface is assumed.
* The application is not expected to run well on all devices, but should provide an explanation to users when a device does not meet minimum requires.
* Users will be exploring large sets of data in the application.
* Data manipulation and visualization are core features.
* The application should be responsive; performance is a high priority.
